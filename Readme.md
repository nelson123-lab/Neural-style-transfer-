Neural style transfer is a computer vision technique that involves transferring the style of one image onto the content of another image. It is a form of image stylization that uses deep neural networks to combine the content of one image with the style of another image. 

The technique involves training a neural network on a style image and a content image separately. The network then generates a new image that combines the content of the content image with the style of the style image. The network achieves this by optimizing the input image to minimize both the content loss and the style loss.

The content loss measures the difference between the features of the input image and the features of the content image. The style loss measures the difference between the correlations of the features of the input image and the features of the style image. The network adjusts the input image to minimize both the content loss and the style loss simultaneously, resulting in a new image that combines the content of the content image with the style of the style image.

Neural style transfer can be used for various applications, such as creating artistic images, generating visual effects in movies, and even for fashion and interior design. It has gained popularity due to its ability to generate visually appealing and unique images that combine the content of one image with the style of another.
