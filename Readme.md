Neural style transfer is a computer vision technique that involves transferring the style of one image onto the content of another image. It is a form of image stylization that uses deep neural networks to combine the content of one image with the style of another image. 

The technique involves training a neural network on a style image and a content image separately. The network then generates a new image that combines the content of the content image with the style of the style image. The network achieves this by optimizing the input image to minimize both the content loss and the style loss.

The content loss measures the difference between the features of the input image and the features of the content image. The style loss measures the difference between the correlations of the features of the input image and the features of the style image. The network adjusts the input image to minimize both the content loss and the style loss simultaneously, resulting in a new image that combines the content of the content image with the style of the style image.

Neural style transfer can be used for various applications, such as creating artistic images, generating visual effects in movies, and even for fashion and interior design. It has gained popularity due to its ability to generate visually appealing and unique images that combine the content of one image with the style of another.

Steps involved in process:-

1. Load the pre-trained VGG network: TensorFlow provides pre-trained VGG networks that can be used for neural style transfer. Load the VGG network using the tf.keras.applications.vgg19 module.

2. Define the content and style images: Choose a content image and a style image that you want to combine. Load the images using the tf.keras.preprocessing.image module.

3. Preprocess the images: Preprocess the content and style images by resizing them and normalizing the pixel values.

4. Define the content and style representations: Use the pre-trained VGG network to extract the features of the content and style images at different layers of the network. This can be done by creating a new model that outputs the feature maps of the desired layers.

5. Define the loss functions: Define the content loss and style loss functions based on the differences between the content and style representations of the input image and the target images.

6. Define the total loss: Combine the content loss and style loss into a total loss by weighting them appropriately.

7. Optimize the input image: Use an optimization algorithm to minimize the total loss and update the input image iteratively.

8. Output the stylized image: Output the final stylized image that combines the content of the content image with the style of the style image.
